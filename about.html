									<h1 style=font-size:50px>Annyeong! | 안녕</h2>
									<p>My Name is Andrew and I am Web Developer with a passion for Photography, mainly Portrait photography. I am based in Toronto, Ontario.</p>

								<h2>Why Photography?</h2>
								
								<p>
									My interest in photography was first kindled in 2014 upon meeting my partner. Upon examining various Instagram profiles, I was struck by the captivating imagery of individuals and their companions in scenic locations worldwide. This prompted me to ponder whether I possessed the ability to achieve similar outcomes. My aim was to enhance my partner's self-assurance and capture her beauty.
								</p>

									<p>
										Over the course of several years, I experimented with various camera models but found that the resulting images faileld to meet what I envisioned. It was not until 2017 that I acquired my initial full-frame mirrorless camera, accompanied by a 50mm lens. This marked a turning point, as it enabled me to achieve a creative vision I had previously encountered in the Instagram profiles.
									</p>
								
								<p>
									In 2021, I resolved to create a website with the aim of showcasing my artistic vision, personal journey, and the progress I have achieved thus far. My goal is to expand my skills beyond portrait photography and explore landscape/car photography. While I am still an amateur, I am committed to improvement and growth, with this website serving as a visual documentation of my artistic journey.
								</p>

								<h2>My Gear</h2>
								<p>The current setup I am using is, Sony A7R Mark 4 Camera with the lenses: Sigma 105mm F1.4, Sony Zeiss 16-35mm F4, Rokinon 35mm F1.4. </p>
								<p>Other Gears I use are: Canon AE-1 Film Camera, Fujifilm x100V and my iPhone 14 Pro Max</p>
