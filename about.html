									<h1 style=font-size:50px>Annyeong! | 안녕</h2>
									<p>My Name is Andrew and I am Web Developer with a passion for Photography, mainly Portrait photography. I am based in Toronto, Ontario.</p>
									<p></p>

								<h2>Why Photography?</h2>
								
								<p>
									My passion for taking pictures started back in 2014 when I met my girlfriend. I would see many Instagram profiles, that would take these amazing pictures of their significant other around the world, 
									and I thought to myself, will I be able to produce the same results? I wanted to boost my girlfriend's confidence and to show her how beautiful she REALLY was.
								</p>

									<p>
										As the years progressed, I went through many cameras but the pictures wouldn't come out as I envisioned. It was only in 2017 that I decided to buy my first Full-Frame Mirrorless Camera with a 50mm lens. 
										My pictures would then come out closer and closer to what I saw in those Instagram profiles back in 2014.
									</p>
								
								<p>
									Fast forward to 2021, I wanted to build a website to show everyone my vision, my story, and how far I've come. I hope to expand more to landscape photography rather than heavily being a portrait photographer.
								</p>

								<h2>My Gear</h2>
								<p>The current setup I am using is, Sony A7R Mark 4 Camera with the lenses: Sigma 105mm F1.4, Sony Zeiss 16-35mm F4, Rokinon 35mm F1.4. </p>
								<p>Other Gears I use are: Canon AE-1 Film Camera, and my iPhone 14 Pro Max</p>
